# Education

Reflecting on educating, I must have more than 25 years of experience with teaching. I think one of my first accounts with teaching is instructing sailing at an age of 14. When I was 16, I became an instructor in the Martial Art (Pencak Silat) that I was practicing. In hindsight, it thus seemed to be a logical step to do the minor education in my third year of the study Applied Physics and to become a secondary school teacher after my masters. I have been teaching physics in secondary school for ten years (2009-2019). 

With the idea that I had not reached my educational limits, and to be an example to my pupils that one always can learn more, I applied for [NWO Doctoral Grant for Teachers](https://www.nwo.nl/onderzoeksprogrammas/promotiebeurs-voor-leraren). This grant was awarded in 2014 allowing me to do a PhD. (0.4 FTE - 5 years) on teaching scientific inquiry in physics {cite:p}`pols2023development`. 

In 2019 I switched from secondary education to university, becoming the coordinator of the First Year Physics Lab Course (FYPLC), which I still am.


## Innovating lab courses
On March 1, 2019, I started my position at TU Delft as a lecturer/innovator for the physics lab courses (PLC). The assignment given by Prof. Chris Kleijn (then program director) had three objectives:  

- Modernize the NP to align with 21st-century educational standards.  
- Increase student motivation for the practicum.  
- Focus on teaching students how to conduct research.  

The PLC consists of two courses:  

- **TN1405-P**: A 6-ECTS introductory practicum for first-year students.  
- **TN2985**: A 2-ECTS *Introduction to Experimentation* course for minor students.  

### 2019
**TN1405 included:**  
- Python programming.  
- Measurement and Uncertainty (lecture and tutorial).  
- Introduction Experiments 1 & 2.  
- Eight follow-up experiments focused on physics phenomena (*concept-based practica*).  

**TN2985 included:**  
- Measurement and Uncertainty.  
- Introduction Experiments 1 & 2.  

The assignments and lectures in TN2985 were one-on-one translations of TN1405 manual. The course was supported by two administrative staff members and a technician. Attendance tracking was manual, using physical cards.  

### Changes
**TN2985**  
A completely new program was developed for the minor course. Students now enjoy significant flexibility, both in progressing at their own pace (for Python and report writing) and in choosing experiments. As a result, student satisfaction increased from **5.7 (2019) to 8.0 (2020) to 8.2 (2021)**.  

**Key Changes**  

- New Python, data analysis, and error propagation module with an online test.  
- Attendance required only for the practicum; the rest is self-study with optional scheduled contact hours.  
- Rapid feedback on the first report (within 36 hours).  
- Increased freedom of choice in both experiments.  

**Changes to TN1405**  

The entire program was revised, reusing existing experiments in a modified form. The number of labs in **O2 was reduced from 8 to 3**, creating space for a **final project** where students formulate their own research question based on a chosen theme and conduct an accompanying experiment.  

**Key Changes**  

- Reduction of pre-structured labs in **O2** from **8 to 3**.  
- Revision of objectives and guidelines for these labs.  
- Introduction of a **final project** where students design and conduct their own research.  
- Implementation of **blended learning**, with **50% of the work done at home**.  
- Introduction of a **final exam** covering Python, data analysis, measurement, and uncertainty.  
- Complete revision of the **practicum manual**, with links to lectures, assignments, etc.  
- Revision of grading models.  
- Introduction of a new practicum on determining *g* with **0.1% accuracy**.  

### **Administrative Adjustments**  

#### **Summary**  

Administration was previously done using a **physical card system**. This has now been fully digitized and largely automated. TAs can now independently input attendance and grades. As a result, administrative staff are now also involved in **DEF 1 & DEF 2**.  

#### **Key Changes**  

- **Digitization and automation** of tasks.  
- **Freeing up administrative staff** for other courses.  
- **Expanding digital processes** to other courses.

### **Teaching Assistants (TAs)**  

#### **Summary**  

A **6-ECTS practicum** with around **270 students** cannot function without **TAs**. Active recruitment has been established, based on performance, engagement, and interest during the academic year. Efforts have also been made to **retain TAs longer**, partly through specialized **ITAV training**. The total number of TA hours was reduced by **scaling up**, conducting the same experiments in a **studio classroom**, and **designating one day for centralized (online) instruction**.  

#### **Key Changes**  

- **Active recruitment** during the academic year.  
- **More targeted didactic and content training**.  
- **Reduction in required TAs** through scaling and a more central role for the lecturer.

### **Scientific Contributions and Outreach**  

The NP has contributed to both **scientific and educational publications** and has been used to **engage prospective students**. Notable outputs include:  

1. **A Physics Lab Course in Times of COVID-19** *(peer-reviewed article on adapting to home-based practicum)*  
   - [Read here](https://ejrsme.icrsme.com/article/view/20276)  

2. **Students' Report on an Open Inquiry** *(Physics education research paper)*  
   - DOI: 10.1088/1361-6552/ac27f8  

3. **GIREP Symposium** *(Comparison of practicum courses across four universities)*  
   - [Conference abstract](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1025696/book-of-abstracts.pdf)  

4. **Pre-University On-Campus Tracks** *(Engagement program for high school students)*
