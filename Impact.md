# Impact, valorization, leadership, organization

For some, it is straightforward to distinguish between Impact, valorization, leadership, organization. However, in my case, these dimensions are inherently intertwined due to the nature of my work. My research in physics education, teaching, and the dissemination of both research findings and educational materials create impact, shows leadership, ...

Consequently, rather than structuring this chapter strictly along these four traditional themes, I adopt a thematic approach in which these elements naturally emerge. This structure better reflects the reality of my work, where research informs teaching, teaching generates new research questions, and dissemination—whether through academic publications or educational resources—creates impact that extends beyond the immediate academic community.
