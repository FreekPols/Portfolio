# Introduction

Dear committee member,

It is an honour and a pleasure to share my vision statement on my career at Delft University of Technology. Reflecting on my 20+ years in education, my performance over the past six years at TU Delft, and my aspirations for growth—as an educator, scientist, and individual—has been an insightful journey.

The summary of this document can be expressed as:

*To strive for continuous growth, bringing out the best in both myself and others.*

Still, it has been a challenge for me to draft a clear document in which education, research, and valorization are distinguishable components. Starting as a teacher in secondary education, doing a Ph.D. in physics education research, and continuing my career path in academia with a focus on education, my research and teaching are inherently intertwined. With a drive to openly share all educational material (hence, contributing to open education), the creation of evidence-based education (education & research) and valorization are — for me — inseparable, though I have attempted to distinguish them in this document.

This document, written in [MyST](https://mystmd.org/guide), exemplifies how technological advancements can enhance education and research. The MyST and Jupyter projects aim to create interactive scientific publications for the web, with the ability to export content to PDF, LaTeX, and Microsoft Word. While this document is presented as a PDF, it is also available as an [interactive online document](https://freekpols.github.io/Kick-Ass-Prof/). This, partly, shows how our new course manuals are created .. blabla

wat staat er in het document, volgorde.


Sincerely yours,
