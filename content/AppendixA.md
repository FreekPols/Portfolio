| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TN13010 | Inleidend practicum 1 | 25 - now | Coordinator | A redesign of the FYPLC complying with the renewed physics curriculum. It includes now a 2 ECTS project on mechanics. | 
| TN13015 | Inleidend practium 2 | 25 - now| Coordinator | A redesign of the FYPLC complying with the renewed physics curriculum. It includes now a 2 ECTS project on thermodynamics. |
| TN1405 | Inleidend practicum | 19-25 | Coordinator | The first year physics lab course (6ECTS ~240 students) aims at introducing students to the basics of experimental physics. | 
| TN2985 | Introduction to experiments in physics | 19 - 25 | Coordinator | This course (2ECTS ~40 students) introduces students how opted for the minor in physics to the basics of experimental physics. |
| WM0318TN | Wetenschap en argumentatieleer | 22-23  | Tutor | This course introduces the students to the philosophy of science (Nature of Science). In various sessions they discuss their standpoints regarding statements that are introduced in articles. They thereby explore their own views on the nature of science. |
| SL4301 | Implementatie van onderwijs | 23 - now | Guest lecturer | In this course students are introduced to relevant ideas and materials that they can use in their own teaching practices. I introduce them to the use of escaperooms and the use of open online interactive books. |
| SL4220 | Vakdidactiek basis | 22 - now | Guest lecturer | In this lecture I teach the basics of the pedagogy of practical work.  |
| SL4320 | Vakdidactiek verdiepend | 22 - now | Guest lecturer | In this lecture I introduce the students to the use of four different ICT tools which can be used in the classroom. |
