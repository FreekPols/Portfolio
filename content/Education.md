# Education

Reflecting on teaching, I must have more than 25 years of experience. I think one of my first accounts with teaching is instructing sailing at an age of 14. When I was 16, I became an instructor in a Martial Art (Pencak Silat) that I was practicing. In hindsight, it thus seemed to be a logical step to do the minor education in my third year of the study Applied Physics and to become a secondary school teacher after my masters. I have been teaching physics in secondary school for ten years (2009-2019).  

Recognizing that I probably had not yet reached my full potential and wishing to set an example for my pupils that learning is a lifelong journey, I applied for [NWO Doctoral Grant for Teachers](https://www.nwo.nl/onderzoeksprogrammas/promotiebeurs-voor-leraren). This grant was awarded in 2014 allowing me to do a PhD. (0.4 FTE - 5 years) on teaching scientific inquiry in physics {cite:p}`pols2023development`.  

In 2019 I switched from secondary education to university to become the coordinator of the First Year Physics Lab Course (FYPLC) with the task to innovate this course.


## Innovating lab courses
In 2019 I started my position at TU Delft as a lecturer/innovator. The state of the first year physics lab  course (TN1405 - 6 ECTS) was similar as I have had in it 2004 when I was a first year student. From what I understood, the course has run more or less the same for 40 years. The course that was taught for third year minors (TN2985 - 2 ECTS) was a one-on-one translation of the first year course and wasn't much appreciated by the students.

The assignment given by Prof. Chris Kleijn (then program director) had three objectives:
- Modernize the NP to align with 21st-century educational standards.  
- Increase student motivation for the practicum.  
- Focus on teaching students how to conduct research.  

After a year of getting acquainted with the two courses, identifying the bottlenecks and possibilities (also for the administration that was still done on paper and therefor labor intens), I started the innovation process in 2020. The results of the innovation have been published in several educational journals and conference proceedings - especially in @https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.20.010117 .

To summarize, the main changes in the FYPLC that were implemented are:
- Redesign of the entire course to focus on research skills and scientific thinking instead of following instructions to perform experiments.
- Introduction of a new practicum on determining *g* with **0.1% accuracy**.  
- Introduction of a final project where students design and conduct their own experiments (given some constraints).
- Introduction of a **final exam** covering Python, data analysis, measurement, and uncertainty.  
- Implementation of blended learning, reducing contact hours by 50% and allowing students to prepare at home.
- Digitization and automation of administrative tasks, enabling TAs to manage attendance and grading independently.
- Complete revision of the **practicum manual** (twice), with links to lectures, assignments, etc.  
- Revision of grading rubrics.  

A completely new program was developed for the minor course. Students now enjoy significant flexibility, both in progressing at their own pace (for Python and report writing) and in choosing experiments. As a result, student satisfaction increased from **5.7 (2019) to 8.0 (2020) to 8.2 (2021)**.  

Note that a **6-ECTS practicum** with around **240 students** cannot function without **TAs**. Major change have been implemented on this regard as well: Active recruitment has been established, based on performance, engagement, and interest during the academic year. Efforts have also been made to **retain TAs longer**, partly through specialized **ITAV training**. The total number of TA hours was reduced by **scaling up**, conducting the same experiments in a **studio classroom**, and **designating one day for centralized (online) instruction**.  

## Development of a learning pathway on scientific inquiry in the teacher-education program


## Vision
My educational philosophy is that I get students to get a sense of what scientific quality entails in a structured way. There is no single method in science, and there are no set procedures that always lead to the best result. The question at the core is *What decision leads to the best result in the given circumstances?*. Hence, rather than telling students what to do - or following a recipe - they should be considering the quality of their choices and actions throughout the process and, ultimately, be able to argue why their decision is defensible in light of the constraints at that specific moment in time. [^argumentation]

[^argumentation]: I will come back to this in my research section. 

This philosophy sets me as a teacher not in front of the class but in the middle of the classroom, coaching and guiding students in their learning process. I see my role as that of a facilitator who creates an environment where students can explore, experiment, and learn from their experiences. This is not always successful as some students are more acquainted with the idea "tell me what to do, and I will do that (for you)". 

Lastly, I like to explore new ways of teaching, especially with the use of technology. I explored and implemented the use of interactive textbooks (see impact section), and the use of ChatGPT. The latter might especially help students in writing - where I see a lot potential but also want to be cautious that the AI is not taking over their thinking (and thus their learning process). Again my philosophy comes to help here: I want students to be able to get a sense of what quality is, recognize it and therefor know (and understand) whether to adopt (and adapt) a text produced by genAI. 


Zowel een rol bij natuurkunde als in de lerarenopleiding omdat deze kruisbestuiving ideaal is voor beide partijen: de opleiding TN krijgt iemand met zowel vakdidactische, onderwijskundige als inhoudelijke expertise en de lerarenopleiding krijgt iemand met een sterke achtergrond in natuurkunde en vakdidactiek.
