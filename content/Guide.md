# Reader's guide

This document reflects a career in which education, research, and valorization are deeply interconnected. While the formal structure follows these three domains, many of the activities described necessarily contribute to more than one. To support a clear and fair assessment, this guide explains how each chapter is intended to be read and what it demonstrates with respect to my development toward the role of associate professor with an emphasis on education.

## Education — Educational Leadership and Quality at Scale

**How to read this chapter**

Chapter 2 should be read as evidence of my role as an educational leader who designs, coordinates, and continuously improves education at scale. The focus is not on isolated teaching activities, but on systematic transformation of courses, curricula, and teaching practices, grounded in educational principles and sustained over multiple years.

**What this chapter demonstrates**

- Long-term responsibility for large, core courses in the Applied Physics curriculum.
- The ability to translate educational vision into coherent course design, assessment strategies, and organizational structures.
- Leadership in course innovation that improves student learning, motivation, and engagement.
- Attention to scalability, sustainability, and staff development (e.g. TA training, administrative redesign).

Research outputs and publications that emerge from these educational innovations are mentioned only insofar as they show that my teaching practice is scholarly and evidence-informed. The primary lens of this chapter is educational impact on students and programs.

## Research — A Coherent Line of Physics Education Research 
**How to read this chapter**

Chapter 3 presents my work as a physics education researcher who develops theoretical frameworks and empirically grounded insights into scientific inquiry, argumentation, and engineering design. While my research is closely connected to teaching practice, this chapter should be read as a contribution to the international research community, not as a report on educational innovation.

**What this chapter demonstrates**

- A clearly identifiable and coherent research line originating from my PhD and extended through postdoctoral and faculty work.
- Intellectual ownership of a conceptual niche: the integration of argumentation with inquiry and design.

- The development of theoretical models (e.g. linking argumentation to PACKS) with potential for broader applicability.

- A realistic and forward-looking research agenda, including supervision, collaboration, and funding strategies within the constraints of education research.

Educational contexts function here as research settings, not as ends in themselves. The emphasis is on knowledge production, theory building, and scholarly dissemination.

## Impact, Valorization, Leadership, and Organization — Enabling Others

**How to read this chapter**

Chapter 4 should be read through the lens of enabling and amplifying impact beyond my own teaching and research. Rather than separating valorization, leadership, and organization artificially, this chapter adopts a thematic approach that reflects how these dimensions manifest in practice.

**What this chapter demonstrates**

- Leadership in open pedagogy and open education at local, national, and international levels.

- The development of infrastructures (tools, platforms, materials) that enable other educators to innovate.
- Active contribution to professional communities, policy discussions, and teacher professionalization.

- Recognition of my work through awards, invitations, and adoption of materials by others.

Where educational materials or tools originate from teaching or research, they are included here because their primary function is reuse, dissemination, and capacity building.
