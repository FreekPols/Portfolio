# Introduction

Dear committee member,

It is an honour and a pleasure to share my vision statement on my career at Delft University of Technology. Reflecting on my 20$^+$ years in education as a teacher, my performance over the past seven years at TU Delft, and my aspirations for growth as an educator, scientist, and person has been an insightful journey.

The summary of my vision can be expressed as:  

*To strive for continuous growth and excellence in education, bringing out the best in both myself and others.*

But even with this clear, concise and strong statement - covering one of my core values, it has been a challenge to draft a clear document in which education, research, and valorization are distinguishable components. I started as a secondary school teacher, did alongside that job a Ph.D. in physics education, and continued my career in academia with a focus on education. As a result, my research and teaching are inherently intertwined: I study what I teach, and how I teach is grounded in research (scholarly-teaching). With a drive to openly share all educational material (hence, contributing to open education), the creation of evidence-based education (education & research) and valorization (enable life long learning) are for me inseparable, though I have attempted to distinguish them in this document.

This document, written in [MyST](https://mystmd.org/guide), exemplifies my innovative approach to teaching: it is one of the latest technological advancements in education and research dissemination {cite:p}`cockett2024continuous`. The MyST and Jupyter projects aim to create interactive scientific publications for the web, with the ability to export content to PDF, LaTeX, and Microsoft Word. While this document is presented as a PDF, it is also available as an [interactive online document](https://freekpols.github.io/Kick-Ass-Prof/). It is also the way the tool which supports the newest online interactive textbook publications, see for instance [TUD's first year physics mechanics book](https://freekpols.github.io/Mechanica/). Moreover, the PDF version of this book is made with a [bare-bone typst template](https://github.com/myst-templates/plain_typst_book) which is made by me and feed back to the MyST ecology. 

wat staat er in het document, volgorde.

Sincerely yours,

Freek Pols
