# Introduction

Dear committee member,

It is an honour and a pleasure to share my vision statement on my career at Delft University of Technology. Reflecting on my 20$^+$ years in education as a teacher and innovator, my performance over the past seven years at TU Delft, and my aspirations for growth as an educator, scientist, and person has been an insightful journey.

The summary of my vision can be expressed as:  

> *To strive for continuous growth and excellence in education, bringing out the best in both myself and others.*

But even with this clear, concise and strong statement - covering one of my core values, it has been a challenge to draft a clear document in which education, research, and valorization are distinguishable components. I started as a secondary school teacher, did alongside that job a Ph.D. in physics education, and continued my career in academia with a focus on education. As a result, my research and teaching are inherently intertwined: I study what I teach, and how I teach is grounded in research (scholarly-teaching). With a drive to openly share all educational material (hence, contributing to open education), the creation of evidence-based education (education & research) and valorization (enable life long learning) are for me inseparable, though I have attempted to distinguish them in this document.

This document, written in [MyST](https://mystmd.org/guide) - also known as JupyterBook, exemplifies my innovative approach to teaching: it is one of the latest technological advancements in education and research dissemination {cite:p}`cockett2024continuous`. The MyST and Jupyter projects aim to create interactive scientific publications for the web, with the ability to export content to PDF, LaTeX, and Microsoft Word. While this document is presented as a PDF, it is also available as an [interactive online document](https://freekpols.github.io/Portfolio/). Moreover, this technology is used for the latest online interactive textbook publications, see for instance [TUD's first year physics mechanics book](https://freekpols.github.io/Mechanica/). 

Where in former years at Delft we have used this technology (were consumers of the system), we now have come to a stage where we actively contribute to the development of the MyST ecosystem (become producers of the system). For instance, this PDF version is made  with a self-made [bare-bone typst template](https://github.com/myst-templates/plain_typst_book) which is open access available. 

## How to read this document
To support a clear and fair assessment, this guide explains how each chapter is intended to be read and what it demonstrates with respect to my development toward the role of associate professor with an emphasis on education.

[Chapter 2](./Education.md) should be read as evidence of my role as an educational leader who designs, coordinates, and continuously improves education at scale. The focus is not on isolated teaching activities, but on systematic transformation of courses, curricula, and teaching practices, grounded in educational principles and sustained over multiple years.

[Chapter 3](./Research.md) presents my work as a physics education researcher who develops theoretical frameworks and empirically grounded insights into scientific inquiry, argumentation, and engineering design. While my research is closely connected to teaching practice, this chapter should be read as a contribution to the international research community, not as a report on educational innovation.

[Chapter 4](./Impact.md) highlights my efforts to enable and amplify impact beyond my own teaching and research. This includes valorization of educational materials, leadership in professional communities, and organizational contributions that support others in innovating their educational practices. I make a clear distinction between local, national and international efforts.

Further evidence per chapter is provided in the [appendices](./Appendix.md). These appendices include detailed descriptions of courses taught, research publications, and valorization activities. While these chapters contain important information, they should be read as supplementary material that substantiates the main narrative.

Sincerely yours,

Freek Pols
